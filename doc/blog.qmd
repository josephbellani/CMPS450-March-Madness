Every year I watch the NCAA College Basketball Tournament (March Madness) with my dad, always filling out brackets to see how well we can predict the tournament. All across the country, people fill out brackets doing the same. This year roughly 20 million people filled out a bracket. To this date not a single person has filled out a perfect bracket, with most, if not all, brackets predicting a game wrong before the end of the first round. There are over 2.1 billion possible bracket combinations, 10 times the number of brackets that were filled out this year. Below is a video from the official March Madness YouTube Channel outlining how every bracket busted in 2023.
<br/>

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yU3FM90cts&t=8s >}}

As a result, I created this project to take a look into what qualifies a team to make the NCAA College Basketball Tournament, as well as what teams are predicted to de well by a simulation model for this year's tournament.

# Data Collection

For this project, all of the data was collected using web scraping. There are two main datasets that were created. The first data set includes team statistics from the years 2012-2022 (except for 2019-20 due to the shortened season as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). The second data set contains game-level data from the 2022-23 season, containing each team’s average points scored per game, standard deviation of points scored per game, and average points allowed per game. The websites scraped were @kenpom, @wikipedia, @teamrankings, and @CBS.


The first of the two data sets focuses on the historical side of the tournament. Five randomly selected rows are shown below. The dataset is populated with every team that has qualified for the March Madness Tournament in the past 10 years. The dimensions of this data set were 680 rows by 30 columns, providing a wide array of statistics to look at.  

```{python}
import pandas as pd
fullstats = pd.read_csv("fullstats.csv")

fullstats.sample(n=5)
```

<br/>
The second of the two created data sets focused on this year's tournament (2023). This data set was much smaller than the previous dataset, but originally had roughly 5,500 rows before the data was prepared. As you can see below this data set shows 3 statistics for each team in 2023. Every Division 1 college team has a row, with the dimensions being 367 rows by 3 columns.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
AllStats = pd.read_csv("AllStats.csv")

AllStats.head()
```
# Results

## Which teams made March Madness?

To look into the past teams who have qualified for the tournament I opted to look at the previous 10 years' tournaments. Some of the statistics we will be looking at include Wins, Strength of Schedule and Conference. Wins is the total number of games won in that season, Strength of Schedule is a measure of how difficult a team's season was (The team that played the hardest opponents that season would be ranked as '1' for this variable), and conference is simply the conference in which the team plays.

@fig-seed below shows us which statistic, Wins or Strength of Schedule, has more correlation with earning a higher seeds (1 being the highest and 16 the lowest) in March Madness. Obviously, teams who played the most difficult teams and won those games earned the best seeds. What is more interesting is the difference between teams with higher win counts and lower strength of schedules versus the opposite. It is apparent that strength of schedule is more impactful than number of wins, as some purple dots can be found in the bottom left of the scatter plot, but none are  found on the right of the plot.

```{python}
#| label: fig-seed
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of Seed determined by Wins and Strength of Schedule"
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fullstats = pd.read_csv("fullstats.csv")

# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(fullstats["AdjEM Rank"], fullstats.Wins, c = fullstats.Seed)

# Add axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('Strength of Schedule Rank')
plt.ylabel('Wins')
plt.title('Seed by Wins and Strength of Schedule')

# Create and format the colorbar
cbar = plt.colorbar()
cbar.ax.invert_yaxis()  # invert the colorbar scale
cbar.set_label('Seed')

# Display the plot
plt.show()


# While it may have been obvious already, this chart shows that teams must have a good combination between wins and strength
# of schedule to earn a high seed, if you do not play other good teams it is unlikely you earn a top seed.
```

@fig-map shows the distribution of March Madness teams by the states in which the school is located. Texas leads the pack, having a plethora of schools eligible for March Madness. More of a surprise to those who are not fans of college basketball, North Carolina ranks second among all states as it has perennial favorites, such as Duke, who make the tournament almost every year. Sorry to anyone who lives in Maine, New Hampshire, or Alaska as not a single team from those states has made one of the past ten March Madness Tournaments.

```{python}
#| label: fig-map
#| fig-cap: "Map of March Madness Teams by State (2012-2022)"
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
fullstats = pd.read_csv("fullstats.csv")

# Group by state and count the occurrences of each two-letter abbreviation
state_counts = fullstats['State'].value_counts().reset_index(name='count').rename(columns={'index': 'state'})

# Create a choropleth map
fig = px.choropleth(state_counts, locations='state', locationmode='USA-states', color='count', scope='usa', color_continuous_scale='YlOrRd')

# Set title and colorbar label
fig.update_layout(title_text='March Madness Teams by State')
fig.update_coloraxes(colorbar_title='# of Teams')

# Show the plot
fig.show()

# The field seems to be made up of mainly teams from Texas, California, Virginia, New York, North Carolia and Ohio. The two
# states that stand the most are Texas and North Carolina as Texas features a lot of Power 5 schools, while North Carolina 
# is top heavy having perennial favorites such as North Carolina and Duke that make the field almost every year.
```

@fig-piechart below shows the distribution of teams in March Madness by the conference in which they play. The largest piece of the pie went to the 1-bid conferences, which are the conferences that sent one team each year, the guaranteed minimum. When looking at @fig-map these conferences make sense to be the top team senders as they are mainly located on the east coast, in the midwest, and in Texas.

```{python}
#| label: fig-piechart
#| fig-cap: "Pie Chart of March Madness teams by Conference"
import pandas as pd
MMteams = pd.read_csv("MMteams.csv")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Counts how many occurences of each conference are found in the dataset
n = 15
conference_counts = MMteams['Conference'].value_counts()
top_conferences = conference_counts[:n].index.tolist()
MMteams.loc[~MMteams['Conference'].isin(top_conferences), 'Conference'] = '1 Bid Conferences'
conference_counts = MMteams['Conference'].value_counts()

# Plots the resulting Pie Chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.pie(conference_counts, labels=conference_counts.index, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Conference Distribution')
plt.show()

# The 1-bid Conferences were the conferences in which between 2012 and 2022 only had one team each year. An interesting note
# is that the "Power 5" were not the top 5 conferences on the list as the SEC and the Pac-12 both fell underneath the Big 
# East in this chart
```

Next we will look at each conference's average seed. @fig-confseeds shows us two clear groups of teams. The division comes between the Atlantic 10 and Conference-USA (C-USA). The best conferences make up the highest seeded group. Some outliers do exist however as the West Coast Conference and the American Athletic Conference are heavily weighted by one team, Gonzaga and Houston respectively. The teams at the very bottom of this graph are also the teams that made up the 1-Bid Conferences in @fig-piechart.

```{python}
#| label: fig-confseeds
#| fig-cap: "Average Seed of Conferences"

import sys

if not sys.warnoptions:
    import warnings
    warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
import pandas as pd
MMteams = pd.read_csv("MMteams.csv")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Group by year and calculate the mean of PPG and OppPPG
MMteams['Seed'] = MMteams['Seed'].astype(str)

# Removes all *'s and #'s from the Seed Column, and makes Seed a Float
MMteams['Seed'] = MMteams['Seed'].str.replace('*', '')
MMteams['Seed'] = MMteams['Seed'].str.replace('#', '')
MMteams['Seed'] = MMteams['Seed'].astype(float)


# Plot the dual bar chart
avg_seed = MMteams.groupby('Conference')['Seed'].mean()
avg_seed_sorted = avg_seed.sort_values(ascending=False)

# Create a bar chart of the average seed by conference
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 7))

# plot the bar chart
ax.barh(avg_seed_sorted.index, avg_seed_sorted.values)

# customize the chart
ax.set_title('Average Seed by Conference')
ax.set_xlabel('Average Seed')
ax.set_ylabel('Conference')
plt.show()

# There is an obvious jump between the Atlantic 10 and Conference USA on this chart. The reason is likely because the 
# conferences below the A10 usually get one sometimes two teams into the tournament, and since their teams are not as good
# as the other conferences their teams struggle to gain a high enough Strength of Schedule to both make the tournament,
# as well as earning top seeds
```

## Which teams will do well this year?

To answer this question I decided to use a Monte Carlo Simulation on the Tournament. This involves taking two teams and simulating many games between them. For this project, each matchup was March Madness will be simulated 10,000 times. I used each team's average points scored, the standard deviation of points scored, and average points allowed to help predict both teams' points in each of the 10,000 simulated games they played against each other. Each team's score is calculated using their average points scored and their opponents' average points against.

For example, if I wanted to simulate the National Championship game from this year (UConn vs San Diego State) I would input both of their names into the code. 

Displayed in @fig-sim is the resulting simulation between UConn and San Diego State. In line with public opinion, UConn was picked by the simulation model to win the National Championship, with the model choosing UConn in roughly 56% of each simulated game. While the model was more modest than the public (UConn was favored by 7.5 points for betting), the difference in wins was significant enough to conclude that the model would choose UConn every time the simulation is ran. 
```{python}
#| label: fig-sim
#| fig-cap: "Simulated Wins for UConn and San Diego State"

# This is where the teams are chosen for the simulation
import pandas as pd
import math
from scipy.stats import norm
from numpy.random import uniform
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
AllStats = pd.read_csv("AllStats.csv")
AllStats
team1 = "UConn"
team2 = "San Diego St"

# Assigns variables to team 1
Team1PF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team1, 'Points For'].values[0]
Team1PA = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team1, 'Points Against'].values[0]
Team1SDPF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team1, 'Standard Deviation'].values[0]

# Assigns variables to team 2
Team2PF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team2, 'Points For'].values[0]
Team2PA = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team2, 'Points Against'].values[0]
Team2SDPF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team2, 'Standard Deviation'].values[0]

# Creates Adjusted points for both teams based on values from each team
Team1ADJ = math.sqrt(Team1PF * Team2PA)
Team2ADJ = math.sqrt(Team2PF * Team1PA)

# Generates one score for team 1
norm.ppf(
  uniform(0, 1),
  loc=Team1ADJ,
  scale=Team1SDPF
)

# Generates one score for team 2
norm.ppf(
  uniform(0, 1),
  loc=Team2ADJ,
  scale=Team2SDPF
)

# Names variables used for simulation
N = 10000
outcome = np.empty(N, dtype='object')

# Runs the simulation 10,000 times
for i in range(N):
    d = (np.random.normal(loc=Team1ADJ, scale=Team1SDPF) -
         np.random.normal(loc=Team2ADJ, scale=Team2SDPF))
    d = team1 if d > 0 else team2
    outcome[i] = d

# Makes variables to help with visualization
outcome_series = pd.Series(outcome)
table = outcome_series.value_counts()
rel_freq = table / table.sum()

# Plots the relative frequencies as a bar chart
plt.bar(x=rel_freq.index, height=rel_freq.values)
plt.ylabel('Percentage of Simulated Games Won')
# Plots Bar Graph and exact values for the Monte Carlo Simulation
print(table)
plt.show()

```

To answer the question of which teams the model predicts to do well inI simulated each game of the 2023 March Madness tournament, the NIT (National Invitational Tournament), and the conference tournaments of the six conferences that have sent the most teams over the past 10 years (see @fig-piechart). What was found is that the conference tournaments were the most accurately predicted, followed by March Madness, then the NIT. The accuracies for each grouping are shown below.

```{python}
#| label: fig-accuracy
#| fig-cap: "Accuracies of Tournaments as Predicted by Simulation"
values = [37/63, 15/31, 52/70]
labels = ['MM', 'NIT', 'Conference Tournaments']

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.bar(labels, values)
ax.set_ylabel('Accuracy')
ax.set_xlabel('Tournament')
ax.set_title('Accuracy of Model by Tournament Projected')

plt.show()
```

When looking at which tournaments were predicted the best, the shortcomings of the model were more evident than ever. Strength of schedule was not a factor used when simulating. Since the conference tournaments were between teams playing similar schedules strength of schedule was not a factor. However, for March Madness big underdogs like Montana State were predicted to beat top-ranked teams such as Kansas State and Kentucky, while the NIT predicted lower-rated teams winning at extremely high rates. The issue is that just looking at box scores ignores how rigorous the team's schedule was. If there was a way to take strength of schedule or conference into account, the accuracy of the model for March Madness and the NIT would likely increase.

Overall, Houston and Tennessee were the two teams that the model predicted to make the  National Championship Game for March Madness. As we learned earlier the two teams that actually made the championship were San Diego State and UConn, which means the model was off in its prediction.

# Bracket Generator

Another feature of this project was the ability to generate an entire bracket with one click. Below bracket resulting from simulating the entire tournament. Each game in this bracket was simulated 10,000 times, and yet each time the simulation runs, a slightly different bracket will be generated. One of the features of the code is that the number of games played can be specified before the simulation. So if I wanted to make a bracket that simulated each game once, I could by simply changing the parameter.

 Although the amount of simulations is meant to reduce variability, it does not remove it completely. Games that predict each team with close to half the wins could fall either way, leading to an entirely new bracket.

```{python}
def Simulate(team1, team2, N):
    # Assigns variables to team 1
    Team1PF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team1, 'Points For'].values[0]
    Team1PA = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team1, 'Points Against'].values[0]
    Team1SDPF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team1, 'Standard Deviation'].values[0]

    # Assigns variables to team 2
    Team2PF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team2, 'Points For'].values[0]
    Team2PA = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team2, 'Points Against'].values[0]
    Team2SDPF = AllStats.loc[AllStats['Team'] == team2, 'Standard Deviation'].values[0]

    Team1ADJ = math.sqrt(Team1PF * Team2PA)
    Team2ADJ = math.sqrt(Team2PF * Team1PA)

    # Names variables used for simulation
    outcome = np.empty(N, dtype='object')

    # Runs the simulation 10,000 times
    for i in range(N):
        d = (np.random.normal(loc=Team1ADJ, scale=Team1SDPF) -
             np.random.normal(loc=Team2ADJ, scale=Team2SDPF))
        d = team1 if d > 0 else team2
        outcome[i] = d

This feature, along with the single game simulation, is only currently set up for the 2023 season. All that would be necessary for this code to work with any other season is the list of the teams competing in the tournament. Along with that, the points dataset equivalent for that year would be needed, which is also easily attainable due to the earlier web scraping work that is replicable for any season on the CBS website.

# Future Work

There are two main things that I would like to add to this project. Firstly, as mentioned previously, the lack of the model to being able to incorporate strength of schedule is currently not up to par. Adding something to account for the different schedules played in college basketball would go a long way in improving this model. A second addition would be to add a score to the bracket generator. This would be accomplished by awarding points if the simulator chose the correct team to advance each round. Generating the bracket would then not only produce a new bracket but also measure how accurate the bracket predicted the games when compared to what actually happened. On top of the fun part of that addition, it would also be very practical. When adjusting the model I would be able to also run tests to see if the average score of the model went up or down as a result of the change, intertwining both ends of the future work of this project.
